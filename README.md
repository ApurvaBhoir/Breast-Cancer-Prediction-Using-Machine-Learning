# Advanced Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive case study that applies advanced machine learning techniques to breast cancer diagnosis. The project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to accurately classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant, showcasing key skills and methodologies relevant to healthcare data analytics.

## Project Structure

- **Final Report:** [Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis_Report.pdf]  
  A detailed report outlining the methodology, results, and business implications of the machine learning models. The report includes all relevant analyses, ethical considerations, and recommendations for future work.

- **Code:** [breast_cancer_diagnosis_annotated_code.py]  
  Python script used to preprocess the data, build the machine learning models, and generate the key results discussed in the final report. The code is annotated for clarity and aligned with industry best practices.

- **Visualizations:**  
  Contains all visualizations generated during the analysis, including ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, confusion matrices, SHAP value summary plots, and feature importance graphs.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) from Kaggle. It includes features extracted from breast cancer images and corresponding diagnosis labels, which were used to train and evaluate the machine learning models in this project.

Key Sections of the Code
Data Preprocessing
Handles data cleaning, including handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numeric, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Development
Implements and tunes Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to classify breast cancer tumors.

Model Evaluation
Calculates performance metrics such as ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curves, and confusion matrices to evaluate model accuracy.

Feature Importance and Interpretability
Utilizes SHAP values for XGBoost and feature importance analysis for Logistic Regression to understand the factors driving model predictions.

Ethical Considerations
The project emphasizes the ethical use of predictive modeling in healthcare, particularly ensuring that the model's insights do not lead to discrimination or bias. The model aligns with value-based care principles, focusing on enhancing patient-centered outcomes while maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations such as HIPAA.

Future Work
Future directions include exploring ensemble methods that combine the strengths of multiple models, incorporating additional data sources such as genetic information, and refining the models for deployment in clinical settings.

Conclusion
This case study highlights the practical application of machine learning in healthcare, particularly in diagnostic settings where model accuracy and interpretability are crucial. Accurate predictions can lead to more timely and effective interventions, ultimately improving patient care and optimizing the use of healthcare resources.
