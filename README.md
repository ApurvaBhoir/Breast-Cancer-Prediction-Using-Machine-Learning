# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

This repository features Python code for predicting breast cancer diagnoses using machine learning models, demonstrating end-to-end data analytics and modeling skills. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation, offering practical insights into breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## Objective

Develop machine learning models to predict breast cancer diagnoses based on patient features and diagnostic data. The focus is on enhancing diagnostic accuracy to support better clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** Kaggle - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
- **Features:**
  - **Patient Metrics:** Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension.
  - **Diagnosis:** Malignant or benign (target variable)

## Methodology Overview

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  - Converted categorical labels ('diagnosis') to numeric format (Malignant=1, Benign=0).
  - Handled missing data and standardized numerical features.
  - Split data into training and testing sets.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and relationships with the target variable.
  - Identified significant predictors of breast cancer diagnoses.

- **Modeling:**
  - Built and tuned multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
  - Cross-validation employed to ensure robustness and generalizability.
